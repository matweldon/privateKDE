Title: Privacy Preserving Nearest Neighbour Kernel Resampling for Map Data 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mat Weldon
Maintainer: Mat Weldon <dr.mat.weldon@gmail.com>
Description: The package provides functions that resample x,y points
     in a way that provides privacy guarantees. A kernel density is
     constructed such that points in sparse regions have a larger bandwidth
     and points in denser regions have a smaller bandwidth. This guarantees
     that kernels overlap with high probability.
